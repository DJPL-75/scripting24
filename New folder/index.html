                <h3> Upbringing</h3>
                <p>Dominic was born in the city of Lethbridge, Alberta, Canada and was raised in the nearby town of Coaldale. from the ages of 8 to present he spends much of his time at home playing video games (often to his academic detriment). However this is also where hed start to gain an interest in Computers and digital artwork primarily in 3D animation.</p>

            <div class="col-sm-6">
                <h3>Education</h3>
                <p>Dominic's experience with grade school is a largely irrelevant blur of violence and embarrassing moments to randomly haunt him throughout The rest of his life. However right around the end is when he started to realize his passion for creation through the very small new media class his school offered. Upon reaching High-school Dominic would discover a much better new media class where he would create the works you can find above. Now Dominic finds himself in the Lethbridge Polytechnic expanding upon his knowledge with the hopes of becoming a 3D animator. </p></div>

                <h3>Animals</h3>
                <p>Dominic has five cats, two dogs, and twelve chickens and all of them are described using A rather vulgar tongue. Havoc and Felony are very soft short haired siblings that as their names Imply are trouble. Gata and Star are very fluffy sisters that have decided they are rivals with Havoc and Felony, starting skirmishes randomly throughout the house. Shithead is a shop cat that has been trained to do nothing but sleep and kill stuff, she spends a lot of time staring condescendingly at the skirmishes. The dogs are named Zoey and Cassie. They spend most of their time just roaming the property looking for things to chew on, they are also very hard to get pictures of. The chickens are a single unnamed mass that lives in their coop and just destroys everything they get their beaks on, be it a cricket or a person that comes in to feed them.</p></div>

                  <h3>Other interests</h3>
                  <p>Dominic has two major interests outside of digital art being gaming and metal music. He has no favorite games as it switches every week but the games that stand out are primarily survival, factory builder, and RTS games like 7 Days to Die, Satisfactory, and Starcraft II. Although he also dabbled in shooter games building a rather proficient skill in long range precision. As for music Dominic likes to listen to fast and loud metal adjacent bands like Halestorm, Avenged Sevenfold, Alestorm, and Disturbed while also enjoying many indie bands of a similar caliber. He has a disdain for rap music as he finds it either too quiet or too slow. </p> </div>
